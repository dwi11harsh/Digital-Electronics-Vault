Procedure of designing a combinational circuit involves following steps:
1. Problem statement is made.
2. number of inputs and required outputs are determined
3. Input and output variables are assigned letter symbols.
4. The truth table that defines the required relationships between inputs and outputs is derived.
5. The simplified Boolean function for each output is obtained.
6. The logic diagram is drawn

Practical method should also consider following constraints
