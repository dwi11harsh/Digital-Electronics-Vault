- Logic circuits for digital systems may be ==combinational== or ==sequential==
- A ==combinational circuit== consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are determined directly from the <u>present combination of inputs without regard to previous inputs</u>.
- ==Sequential circuits== employ memory elements (binary cells) in addition to logic gates. The outputs of a sequential circuit depend not only on present inputs, but also on past inputs, and the circuit behaviour must be specified by a time sequence of inputs and internal states.
