- Logic circuits for digital systems may be ==combinational== or ==sequential==
- A ==combinational circuit== consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are determined directly from the <u>present combination of inputs without regard to previous inputs</u>.
- ==Sequential circuits== employ memory elements (binary cells) in addition to logic gates. The outputs of a sequential circuit depend not only on present inputs, but also on past inputs, and the circuit behaviour must be specified by a time sequence of inputs and internal states.

## Combinational Circuit

- The n input binary variables come from an external source the m output variables go to an external destination.
- In many applications, the source and/or destination are storage regis- ters (Section 1-7) located either in the vicinity of the combinational circuit or in a remote external device.
