* The procedure for obtaining a minimised function in product of sums follows from the basic properties of Boolean functions.
	* The 1’s placed in the squares of the map represent the `minterms` of the function.
	* If we mark the empty squares by 0’s and combine them into valid adjacent squares, we obtain a simplified expression of the complement of the function, i.e., of F′.

**Example**:
Consider the following function:
$$F (A, B, C, D) = ∑(0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10)$$
it can be represented as

<u>The configuration pattern established in this example is the general form by which any Boolean function is implemented when expressed in one of the standard forms.</u>
<li>AND gates are connected to a single UR gate when in sum of products; OR gates are connected to a single AND gate when in product of sums.</li>
<li>Either configuration forms two levels of gates.</li>
<li>Thus, the implementation of a function in a standard form is said to be a two-level implementation.</li>
