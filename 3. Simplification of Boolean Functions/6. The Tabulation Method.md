* The map method is good as long as the number of variable does not exceed over 5 or 6. Excessive number of squares prevents a reasonable selection of adjacent squares.
* The obvious disadvantage of the map is that it is essentially a trial-and-error procedure which relies on the ability of the human user to recognise certain patterns.

**The Tabulation method is a specific step-by-step procedure that is guaranteed to produce standard-form expression.**
- It can be applied to problems with many variables and has the advantage of being suitable for machine computation.
- It is quite tedious for human use and is prone to mistakes because of its routine, monotonous process

###### The tabular method consists of two parts
1. Find by an exhaustive search all the terms that are candidates for inclusion in the simplified function. These terms are called <font style="color:yellow">prime-implicants</font>.
2. Choose among the prime-implicants those that give an expression with the least number of literals
