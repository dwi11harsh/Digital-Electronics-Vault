* The procedure for obtaining a minimised function in product of sums follows from the basic properties of Boolean functions.
	* The 1’s placed in the squares of the map represent the `minterms` of the function.
	* If we mark the empty squares by 0’s and combine them into valid adjacent squares, we obtain a simplified expression of the complement of the function, i.e., of F′.
