###### First tabular method is to find prime-implicants by matching process
1. Compare each `minterm` with every other `minterm` 
2. If two `minterms` differ in only one variable, that variable is removed and a term with one less literal is found.
3. This process is repeated for every `minterm` until the exhaustive search is completed.
4. The matching-process cycle is repeated for those new terms just found.
5. Further cycles are continued until a single pass through a cycle yields no further elimination of literals.
6. The remaining terms and all the terms that did not match during the process comprise the prime-implicants.
