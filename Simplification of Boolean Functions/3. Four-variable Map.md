* The `minterm` corresponding to each square can be obtained from the concatenation of the row number with the column number.
* The map minimisation of four-variable Boolean functions is similar to the method used to minimise three-variable functions.
* Adjacent squares are defined to be squares next to each other.
* In addition, the map is considered to lie on a surface with the top and bottom edges, as well as the right and left edges, touching each other to form adjacent squares.
* The combination of adjacent squares during simplification process determine the followings:
	* One square represents one `minterm`, giving a term of four literals.
	* Two adjacent squares represent a term of three literals.
	* Four adjacent squares represent a term of two literals.
	* Eight adjacent squares represent a term of one literal.
	* Sixteen adjacent squares represent the function equal to 1.
