## NAND Implementation
<li>The implementation of a Boolean function with NAND gates requires that the function be simplified in the sum of products form.</li>

###### Rules for obtaining the NAND logic diagram from a Boolean function is as follows:
1. Simplify the function and express it in sum of products.
2. Draw a NAND gate for each product term of the function that has at least two literals. The inputs to each NAND gate are the literals of the term, This constitutes a group of first-level gates.
3. Draw a single NAND gate (using the AND-invert or invert-OR graphic symbol) in the second level, with inputs coming from outputs of first-level gates.
4. A term with a single literal requires an inverter in the first level or may be complemented and applied as an input to the second-level NAND gate.
## NOR Implementation
* The NOR function is the dual of the NAND function.
* For this reason, all procedures and rules for NOR logic are the dual of the corresponding procedures and rules developed for NAND logic.
