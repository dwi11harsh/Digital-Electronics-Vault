* The combinations are usually obtained from a truth table that lists the conditions under which the function is a 1
* The function is assumed equal to 0 under all other conditions.
* This assumption is not always true since there are applications where certain combinations of input variables never occur.
	* A four-bit decimal code, for example, has six combinations which are not used. Any digital circuit using this code operates under the assumption that these unused combinations will never occur as long as the system is working properly.
	* As a result, we don’t care what the function output is to be for these combinations of the variables because they are guaranteed never to occur.
* These don’t-care (*X*) conditions can be used on a map to provide further simplification of the function.
