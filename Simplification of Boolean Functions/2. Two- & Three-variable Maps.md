In order to understand the usefulness of map in simplifying Boolean function, one needs to dive deeper into the basic properties possessed by adjacent squares:
* Any two adjacent squares in the map differ by only one variable which is primed in one square and unprimed in the other.
* Now, sum of two `minterms` in adjacent squares can be simplified to a single AND term consisting of two literals. For example: consider the sum of the squares m5 and m7
	$$m_5+m_7=xy'z + xyz=xz(y' +y)=xz$$
* Here the two squares differ by the variable y, which can be removed when the sum of the two `minterms` is formed.
* Thus, any two `minterms` in adjacent squares that are `ORed` together will cause a removal of the different variable.
* Now, m2 and m0 also differ by a single variable $$x'y'z'$$ $$x'yz'$$
* Consequently, the rule of adjacent squares can be extended by considering the map as being drawn on a surface where the right and left edges touch each other to form adjacent squares.
