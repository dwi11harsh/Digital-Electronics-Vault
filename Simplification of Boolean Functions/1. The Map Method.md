* the procedure of minimisation through boolean algebra is awkward because it lacks specific rules to predict each succeeding step in the manipulative process.
* The <u>map method</u> provides a simple straightforward procedure for minimising Boolean functions.
* This method may be regarded either as a pictorial form of a truth table or as an extension of the Venn diagram.
* The map method was first proposed by `Veitch` and  slightly modified by `Karnaugh`, it is also known as <u>Veitch Diagram</u> or the <u>Karnaugh Map</u>.
* By recognising various patterns, the user can derive alternative algebraic expressions for the same function, from which he can select the simplest one.
* ***We shall assume that the simplest algebraic expression is any one in a sum of products or product of sums that has a minimum number of literals. (This expression is not necessarily unique.)***
