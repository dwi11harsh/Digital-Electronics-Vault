<h2>Minterms and Maxterms</h2>
A binary variable may appear either in its normal form (x) or in its complement form (x′).
Consider two binary variables x and y combined with an AND operation. Since each variable may appear in either form, there are four possible combinations: x′y′, x′y, xy′, and xy. Each of these four AND terms represents one of the distinct areas in the Venn diagram and is called a <u>minterm</u> or a <u>standard product</u>.

In a similar fashion, n variables forming an OR term, with each variable being primed or unprimed, provide 2n possible combinations, called <u>maxterms</u> or <u>standard sums</u>.
