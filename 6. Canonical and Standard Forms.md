<h2>Minterms and Maxterms</h2>
A binary variable may appear either in its normal form (x) or in its complement form (x′).
Consider two binary variables x and y combined with an AND operation. Since each variable may appear in either form, there are four possible combinations: x′y′, x′y, xy′, and xy. Each of these four AND terms represents one of the distinct areas in the Venn diagram and is called a <u>minterm</u> or a <u>standard product</u>.

In a similar fashion, n variables forming an OR term, with each variable being primed or unprimed, provide 2n possible combinations, called <u>maxterms</u> or <u>standard sums</u>.
Each <u>maxterm</u> is obtained from an OR term of the n variables, with each variable being unprimed if the corresponding bit is a 0 and primed if a 1.

* Note that each <u>maxterm</u> is the complement of its corresponding <u>minterm</u>, and vice versa.

<u>Boolean functions expressed as a sum of minterms or product of maxterms are said to be in canonical form</u>


<h2>Sum of Minterms</h2>
If not in this form, it can be made so by first expanding the expression into a sum of AND terms. Each term is then inspected to see if it contains all the variables. If it misses one or more variables, it is ANDed with an expres- sion such as x + x′, where x is one of the missing variables.

The summation symbol ∑ stands for the ORing of terms; the numbers following it are the minterms of the function. The letters in parentheses following F form a list of the variables in the order taken when the minterm is converted to an AND term.

<h2>Product of Maxterms</h2>
To express the Boolean function as a product of maxterms, it must first be brought into a form of OR terms. This may be done by using the distributive law $$x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)$$. Then any missing variable x in each OR term is ORed with xx′.

The product symbol, ∏, denotes the ANDing of maxterms; the numbers, are the maxterms of the function.

<h2>Conversion Between Canonical Forms</h2>
The complement of a function expressed as the sum of minterms equals the sum of minterms missing from the original function. This is because the original function is expressed by those minterms that make the function equal to I, while its complement is a 1 for those minterms that the function is a 0. As an example, consider the function:
$$F(A,B, C) = ∑(1,4,5,6,7)$$
This has a complement that can be expressed as:
$$F′(A, B, C) = ∑ (0, 2, 3) = m_0 + m_2 + m_3$$
Now, if we take the complement of F′ by De Morgan’s theorem, we obtain F in a different form:
$$F = (m_0 + m_2 + m_3)' = m'_0 .m'_2 .m'_3= M_0M_2M_3 = ∏ (0, 2, 3)$$
* following relation holds true:
		$$M'_j=m_j$$
	That is, the maxterm with subscript j is a complement of the minterm with the same subscript j, and vice versa.

<h2>General Conversion Procedure</h2>
<u>To convert from one canonical form to another, interchange the symbols ∑ and ∏ and list those numbers missing from the original form.</u>
Example-
$$F(x, y, z) = ∏ (0, 2, 4, 5)$$
is expressed in the product of maxterm form. Its conversion to sum of minterms is:
$$F(x, y, z) = ∑ (1,3,6,7)$$
<u>Note that, in order to find the missing terms, one must realize that the total number of minterms

or maxterms is 2n, where n is the number of binary variables in the function.</u>

<h2>Standard Forms</h2>
<u>In this configuration, the terms that form the function may contain one, two or any number of literals.</u>

The ==sum of products== is a Boolean expression containing AND terms, called product terms, of one or more literals each. The ==sum== denotes the ORing of these terms.
An example of a function expressed in sum of products is:
