<h2>Minterms and Maxterms</h2>
A binary variable may appear either in its normal form (x) or in its complement form (x′).
Consider two binary variables x and y combined with an AND operation. Since each variable may appear in either form, there are four possible combinations: x′y′, x′y, xy′, and xy. Each of these four AND terms represents one of the distinct areas in the Venn diagram and is called a <u>minterm</u> or a <u>standard product</u>.

In a similar fashion, n variables forming an OR term, with each variable being primed or unprimed, provide 2n possible combinations, called <u>maxterms</u> or <u>standard sums</u>.
Each <u>maxterm</u> is obtained from an OR term of the n variables, with each variable being unprimed if the corresponding bit is a 0 and primed if a 1.

* Note that each <u>maxterm</u> is the complement of its corresponding <u>minterm</u>, and vice versa.

<u>Boolean functions expressed as a sum of minterms or product of maxterms are said to be in canonical form</u>


<h2>Sum of Minterms</h2>
If not in this form, it can be made so by first expanding the expression into a sum of AND terms. Each term is then inspected to see if it contains all the variables. If it misses one or more variables, it is ANDed with an expres- sion such as x + x′, where x is one of the missing variables.

The summation symbol ∑ stands for the ORing of terms; the numbers following it are the minterms of the function. The letters in parentheses following F form a list of the variables in the order taken when the minterm is converted to an AND term.

<h2>Product of Maxterms</h2>
To express the Boolean function as a product of maxterms, it must first be brought into a form of OR terms. This may be done by using the distributive law $$x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)$$. Then any missing variable x in each OR term is ORed with xx′.
