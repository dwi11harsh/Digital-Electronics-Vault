Factors to be weighed when considering the construction of other types of logic gates (ones except AND, OR and NOT) are:
1. feasibility and economy of producing the gate with physical components
2. possibility of extending the gate to more than two inputs
3. basic properties of the binary operator such as commutativity and associativity
4. the ability of the gate to implement Boolean functions alone or in conjuction with other gates

**Of the 16 functions defined, two are equal to a constant and four others are repeated twice. There are only ten functions left to be considered as candidates for logic gates. Two, inhibition and implication, are not commutative or associative and thus are impractical to use as standard logic gates. <u>The other eight: complement, transfer, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, exclusive- OR, and equivalence, are used as standard gates in digital design</u>.**

<h3>Inverter</h3>
* The inverter circuit inverts the logic sense of a binary variable.
* It produces the NOT, or complement, function.
* The small circle in the output of the graphic symbol of an inverter designates the logic complement.
* The triangle symbol by itself designates a buffer circuit.
* A <u>buffer</u> produces the transfer function but does not produce any particular logic operation, since the binary value of the output is equal to the binary value of the input. This circuit is used merely for power amplification of the signal and is equivalent to two inverters connected in cascade.
