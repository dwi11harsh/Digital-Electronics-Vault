Factors to be weighed when considering the construction of other types of logic gates (ones except AND, OR and NOT) are:
1. feasibility and economy of producing the gate with physical components
2. possibility of extending the gate to more than two inputs
3. basic properties of the binary operator such as commutativity and associativity
4.
