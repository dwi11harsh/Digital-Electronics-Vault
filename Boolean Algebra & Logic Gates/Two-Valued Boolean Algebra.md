A two-valued Boolean algebra is defined on a set of two elements, B = {0, 1}, with rules for the two binary operators + and • as shown in the following operator tables

These rules are exactly the same as the **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** operations

_Just Examples
	 (a)  x + x′ = 1, since 0 + 0′ = 0 + 1 = 1 and 1 + 1′ = 1 + 0 = 1
	 (b)  x • x′ = 0, since 0 • 0′ = 0 • 1 = 0 and 1 • 1′ = 1 • 0 = 0_

The two-valued Boolean algebra defined in this section is also called ==switching algebra== by engineers.
