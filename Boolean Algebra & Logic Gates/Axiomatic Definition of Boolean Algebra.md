===Boolean Algebra=== a systematic treatment of logic developed for the purpose an algebraic system _Developed by George Boole in 1854_ 

_In 1938 C. E. Shannon introduced_ a two-valued Boolean algebra called ==switching algebra==, in which he demonstrated that the properties of bistable electrical switching circuits can be represented by this algebra.

Boolean algebra resembles ordinary algebra in some respects. The choice of symbols ==+== and ==â€¢== is intentional to facilitate Boolean algebraic manipulations by persons already familiar with ordinary algebra.
