A binary variable can take the value of 0 or 1. A ==Boolean function== is an expression formed with binary variables, the two binary operators **OR** and **AND**, the unary operator **NOT**, **parentheses**, and **equal sign**.

 and 0’s of the $$n$$ binary variables, and a column showing the combinations
