A binary variable can take the value of 0 or 1. A ==Boolean function== is an expression formed with binary variables, the two binary operators **OR** and **AND**, the unary operator **NOT**, **parentheses**, and **equal sign**.

To represent a function in a ==truth table==, we need a list of the $$2^n$$ combinations of 1’s and 0’s of the $$n$$ binary variables, and a column showing the combinations

<h2>Algebraic Manipulations</h2>
A ==literal== is a variable or its complement used in an expression. A variable is a symbol that can take on the value of 0 or 1. A literal is the use of a variable or its complement in an expression.

When a Boolean function is implemented with logic gates, each literal in the function designates an input to a gate, and each term is implemented with a gate.

The minimisation of the number of literals and the number of terms results in a circuit with less equipment.

The number of literals in a Boolean function can be minimised by algebraic manipulations.

The only method available is a cut-and-try procedure employing the postulates, the basic theorems, and any other manipulation method which becomes familiar with use.
