Factors to be weighed when considering the construction of other types of logic gates (ones except AND, OR and NOT) are:
1. feasibility and economy of producing the gate with physical components
2. possibility of extending the gate to more than two inputs
3. basic properties of the binary operator such as commutativity and associativity
4. the ability of the gate to implement Boolean functions alone or in conjuction with other gates

**Of the 16 functions defined, two are equal to a constant and four others are repeated twice. There are only ten functions left to be considered as candidates for logic gates. Two, inhibition and implication, are not commutative or associative and thus are impractical to use as standard logic gates. <u>The other eight: complement, transfer, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, exclusive- OR, and equivalence, are used as standard gates in digital design</u>.**

<h3>Inverter</h3>
* The inverter circuit inverts the logic sense of a binary variable.
* It produces the NOT, or complement, function.
* The small circle in the output of the graphic symbol of an inverter designates the logic complement.
* The triangle symbol by itself designates a buffer circuit.
* A <u>buffer</u> produces the ***transfer*** function but does not produce any particular logic operation, since the binary value of the output is equal to the binary value of the input.
* This circuit is used merely for power amplification of the signal and is equivalent to ***two inverters connected in cascade***.

<h3>NAND & NOR </h3>
* The NAND and NOR gates are extensively used as standard logic gates and are in fact far more popular than the AND and OR gates.
* This is because NAND and NOR gates are easily constructed with transistor circuits and because Boolean functions can be easily implemented with them.

<h3>XOR & XNOR</h3>
* The exclusive-OR gate has a graphic symbol similar to that of the OR gate, except for the additional curved line on the input side.
* The equivalence, or exclusive-NOR, gate is the complement of the exclusive-OR, as indicated by the small circle on the output side of the graphic symbol.

<h2>Extension to Multiple Inputs</h2>
![[Screenshot 2024-10-16 at 11.44.35 AM.png]]

* The gates shown in Fig. 2-5, except for the inverter and buffer, can be extended to have more than two inputs.
* A gate can be extended to have multiple inputs if the binary operation it represents is commutative and associative.
* Commutativity and associativity indicates that inputs can be interchanged and so the function can be extended to three or more variables.

<h3>NAND & NOR</h3>
The NAND and NOR functions are commutative and their gates can be extended to have more than two inputs, provided the definition of the operation is slightly modified.

The difficulty is that the NAND and NOR operators are not associative, i.e., (x ↓ y) ↓z ≠ x ↓ (y ↓ z).
$$(x ↓ y) ↓z = [(x + y)' + z]' = (x + y)z' = xz' + yz'$$
$$x ↓ (y ↓ z) = [x + (y + z)']' = x'(y + z) = x'y + x'z$$

To overcome this difficulty, we define the multiple NOR (or NAND) gate as a complemented OR (or AND) gate. Thus, by definition, we have:
$$x ↓ y ↓ z = (x + y + z)'$$
$$x ↑ y ↑ z = (xyz)'$$
<h3>EXOR and EXNOR (equivalence gate)</h3>
* The exclusive-OR and equivalence gates are both commutative and associative and can be extended to more than two inputs.
* multiple-input exclusive-OR gates are uncommon from the hardware standpoint
* even a two-input function is usually constructed with other types of gates
* also the definitions need to be modified to extend the use of these gates for more than two variables
* <u>The exclusive-OR is an odd function, i.e., it is equal to 1 if the input variables have an odd number of 1’s</u>.
* <u>The equivalence function is an even function, i.e., it is equal to 1 if the input variables have an even number of 0’s</u>.
