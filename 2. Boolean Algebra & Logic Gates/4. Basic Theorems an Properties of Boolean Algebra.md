<h2>Duality</h2>
**Duality Principle** <u>in Boolean Algebra states that if we have true Boolean postulates or equations then the dual of this statement equation is also true.</u>

Thus, a dual of a boolean statement is obtained by replacing the statement’s symbols with their counterparts. This means that “0” becomes a “1”, “1” becomes a “0”, and in a similar way "+" becomes a “.” and “.” becomes a “+”.

<h2>Operator Precedence</h2>
The operator precedence for evaluating Boolean expressions is:
1. Parenthesis
2. NOT
3. AND
4. OR

<h2>Some More Examples</h2>
$$
(x+y)(x+z)=x+yz
$$

$$xy+xz+yz′=xz+yz′$$

<h2>Venn Diagram</h2>

The circle labeled x. If we are inside the circle, we say that x = 1; when outside, we say x = 0.

Now, with two overlapping circles, there are four distinct areas inside the rectangle: the area not belonging to either x or y (x′ y′), the area inside circle y but outside x (x′ y), the area inside circle x but outside y (xy′), and the area inside both circles (xy).
