<u>There are</u> $$2^{2^n}$$ <u>functions for n binary variables</u>

* For two variables, n = 2 and the number of possible Boolean functions is 16. Therefore, the AND and OR functions are only two of a total of 16 possible functions formed with two binary variables.

| Name of the Boolean Function | Boolean Function             | Meaning                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Null                         | \( 0 \)                      | Always 0                                 |
| Identity                     | \( 1 \)                      | Always 1                                 |
| Transfer                     | \( A \)                      | Pass value of \( A \)                    |
| Transfer                     | \( B \)                      | Pass value of \( B \)                    |
| NOT                          | \( \bar{A} \)                | Pass negated value of \( A \)            |
| NOT                          | \( \bar{B} \)                | Pass negated value of \( B \)            |
| AND                          | \( A \bullet B \)            | 1 only if \( A \) and \( B \) are both 1 |
| NAND                         | \( \overline{A \bullet B} \) | 0 only if \( A \) and \( B \) are both 1 |
| OR                           | \( A + B \)                  | 0 only if \( A \) and \( B \) are both 0 |
| NOR                          | \( \overline{A + B} \)       | 1 only if \( A \) and \( B \) are both 0 |
| Implication                  | \( A + \bar{B} \)            | If \( B \), then \( A \)                 |
| Implication                  | \( \bar{A} + B \)            | If \( A \), then \( B \)                 |
| Inhibition                   | \( A \bullet \bar{B} \)      | \( A \) but not \( B \)                  |
| Inhibition                   | \( \bar{A} \bullet B \)      | \( B \) but not \( A \)                  |
| EX-OR                        | \( A \oplus B \)             | \( A \) or \( B \), but not both         |
| EX-NOR                       | \( \overline{A \oplus B} \)  | 1 if \( A \) equals \( B \)              |
