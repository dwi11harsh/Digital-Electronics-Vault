<u>There are</u> $$2^{2^n}$$ <u>functions for n binary variables</u>

* For two variables, n = 2 and the number of possible Boolean functions is 16. Therefore, the AND and OR functions are only two of a total of 16 possible functions formed with two binary variables.

| Name of Boolean Function | Boolean Function | Meaning  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------- |
| Null                     | $$(0 )$$         | Always 0 |
|                          |                  |          |
