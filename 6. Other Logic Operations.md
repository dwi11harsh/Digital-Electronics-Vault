<u>There are</u> $$2^{2^n}$$ <u>functions for n binary variables</u>

* For two variables, n = 2 and the number of possible Boolean functions is 16. Therefore, the AND and OR functions are only two of a total of 16 possible functions formed with two binary variables.

| Name of the Boolean Function | Boolean Function | Meaning                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Null                         | 0                | Always 0                     |
| Identity                     | 1                | Always 1                     |
| Transfer                     | A                | Pass value of A              |
| Transfer                     | B                | Pass value of B              |
| NOT                          | ¬A               | Pass negated value of A      |
| NOT                          | ¬B               | Pass negated value of B      |
| AND                          | A ⋅ B            | 1 only if A and B are both 1 |
| NAND                         | ¬(A ⋅ B)         | 0 only if A and B are both 1 |
| OR                           | A + B            | 0 only if A and B are both 0 |
| NOR                          | ¬(A + B)         | 1 only if A and B are both 0 |
| Implication                  | A + ¬B           | If B, then A                 |
| Implication                  | ¬A + B           | If A, then B                 |
| Inhibition                   | A ⋅ ¬B           | A but not B                  |
| Inhibition                   | ¬A ⋅ B           | B but not A                  |
| EX-OR                        | A ⊕ B            | A or B, but not both         |
| EX-NOR                       | ¬(A ⊕ B)         | 1 if A equals B              |
*Truth tables for the 16 functions of two binary variables*

Although each function can be expressed in terms of the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT, there is no reason one cannot assign special operator symbols for expressing the other functions. Such operator symbols are listed in the second column of following table.
However, all the new symbols shown, except for the exclusive-OR symbol ⊕, are not in common use by digital designers.![[Screenshot 2024-10-16 at 11.02.39 AM.png]]
