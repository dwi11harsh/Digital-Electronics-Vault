The simple addition consists of four possible elementary operations:
$$0+0=0$$
$$0+1=1$$
$$1+0=1$$
$$1+1=10$$
In this last one, the higher significant digit is called **_carry_**. 
- <u>Half-Adder</u>: A combinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits
- <u>Full-Adder</u>: One that performs the addition of three bits (two significant bits and a previous carry)
The name **full-adder** stems from the fact that two **half-adders** can be employed to build one **full-adder**.

The simplified sum of products expressions are:
$$S=x'y+y'x$$
$$C=xy$$

## Full-Adder
- Two of the input variables, denoted by x and y represent the two significant bits to be added.
- The third input, z represents the carry from the previous lower significant position.
